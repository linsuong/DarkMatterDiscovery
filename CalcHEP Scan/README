1) compile with [path to calchep dir]/bin/make_main scan_example.c

2) change paths in scan_example/model/extlib3.mdl to your path to the scan_example/model/ directory

2) run ./a.out

There is a mistake in bin/make_main 
exe=`echo $1 |sed s/.c//` 
should be replaced with 
exe=`echo $1 |sed s/\.c$//`exe=`echo $1 |sed s/\.c$//`

$CALCHEP/bin/make_main scan2.c
