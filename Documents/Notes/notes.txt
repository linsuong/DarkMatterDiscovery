meeting 1:
differnt obs for DM
DM - relic density (well measured)
    - how it interacts with our world (grav waves)

diff models:
    if DM >> grav, then detectable
    underground dirac DM detection (direct)
    indirect detection of DM
    collider search (energy of collider to mass of DM) - invisible recoil visible
        missing momenta

- more observables

- SM 
- particle interaction
- beyond SM - how interaction is different
- calc DM relic density (DM observable)

to do :
plot E against cross section of e+e- -> mu+ mu- (E = 10 -> 200 GeV)
